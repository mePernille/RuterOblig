# RuterOblig
Oblig 2 

We chose to predict passenger data for Ruter (use case number 2).
We chose to use a regression algorithm. In the Ruter data, we could see that the bus we chose (150) had a max capacity of 112 passengers.
If the amount of passengers can be from 0-112, we thought that this would create too many discrete categories for a classification model. 
With a regression algorithm, we can instead map the input to a continuous function.
